  I tried to summarize the important steps and libraries used in the ML project
  rather than focusing on the coding part. The notebook for this chapter is

# 2. End-to-End ML Project

The main steps author goes through in this chapter are:

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

In this chapter, the author goes through a project in which the goal is to predict the median housing price in any district for the Californa Housing Prices [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices).

You are pretending to be a recently hired Data Scientist at a real estate company. Following the steps above you are expected to create a machine learning model that will be fed to another ML system, along with many other signals \(he refers to a piece of information as a **signal**\). Below is an example visualization of an ML pipeline for real estate investments.

**Pipelines:** A sequence of data processing components is called a data _pipeline_. Pipelines are de facto standards of Machine Learning systems since there is a lot of data to preprocess and various transformations to apply.

**Multiple Regression:**  A regression model that consists of multiple features called a _multiple \(univariate if one target variable\) regression model_. 

\( multiple-univariate regression $$ \rightarrow y = w_1 x_1 + ... + w_n x_n + b)$$

**Multivariate Regression:** A regression model in which the numbers of target variables are more than one is called a _multivariate regression model_. 

\( multivariate-multiple $$ \rightarrow y_1 = W_1 X + b_1)$$

                                        $$ \rightarrow \dots  \dots  \dots  \dots   \dots$$

                                        $$ â†’ y_n= W_n X +b_n)$$ where $$X$$ is feature matrix.
