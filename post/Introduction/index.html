          <p>Hi there! This is Salih. I wanted to give a not so brief summary of who I am, and what I do. </p>

<h2 id="headings">The Story of a Curious Little Boy</h2>

<p> My name is Salih Kilicli, and I am an Applied Mathematician. I currently work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant @ Department of Mathematics of <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a> (TAMU). I came to the states around 5 years ago, upon being awarded a government scholarship to pursue a Ph.D. degree and selected as 3<sup>rd</sup> in the field of Mathematics in Turkey. First, I attended 2 summer semesters of an intensive ESL program @ <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>. Later, I got accepted to Ph.D. program of the Department of Mathematics @ A&M. As I was studying Numerical Analysis & Scientific Computing, I hone my skills in programming for the last 5 years and I only had a couple semesters of experience in Fortran before. During my graduate studies I learned MATLAB, Python and R as well as basic SQL and C/C++. Around 2 years ago, I decided to change my career into Data Science as I fell in love with the field upon taking Ph.D. level Statistics courses @ A&M. 
</p>

<p>Originally, it started as a dream to study a postgraduate Math degree in the U.S. from when I was around 5 years old. I was reading encyclopedias in my free time, and was fond of reading biographies of philosophers and inventors. I wanted to make discoveries and help humankind like Thomas A. Edison, Henry Ford, Leonardo da Vinci, Leonhard Euler and other great minds did. As a 1st-generation college student, I found a way to succeed by being persistent on my dreams and made it to the U.S. after being awarded a gov't scholarship. At some point, I felt that my Ph.D. was preventing me from accomplishing my other goals - bigger achievements, and being impactful on a much bigger scale. Not so long after, I realized that I am not enjoying what I am doing, and I am no longer interested in Academia,  while my interest in Machine/Deep Learning & AI was rapidly growing. </p>

<p>Finally, I switched my Ph.D. degree to an M.Sc. in Computational Mathematics while taking statistics courses related to Data Science and Machine Learning. Meanwhile, I wanted to get another M.Sc. in Computer Science / Statistics but unfortunately TAMU doesn't let students to have 2 MS at the same time, so I got an Applied Statistics and a Computational Sciences certificates. I was planning to change my major to Data Science, but the department they were planning to open is postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19, so I decided to create my own Data Science degree taking courses from Statistics department as well as top online courses available on the Internet (will make a post about the details later). Hence, I spent most of my time learning on MOOC platforms as one can easily take courses from the top-level colleges like Stanford, Harvard, MIT, etc. In short, what I am trying to say is that if live gives you lemons, make a lemon juice. There are millions of reasons to complain and give up about your goals, but only one thing is enough to keep growing: <q>"Passion"</q>.</p>

<p>Like Elon Musk felt the bright future of Internet back in 90's and made a very brave decision by giving up on his Ph.D. career, I felt that I couldn't just watch that AI is taking over the world. I believe that future is in Machine/Deep Learning & AI as the data collected within the recent years growing exponentially, and I can't wait to see our future shaping around the intelligent machines and robots that makes human lives even better!</p>

<p>I am here to share my experience and knowledge on various topics such as Mathematics, Statistics, Machine & Deep Learning. I will be posting stories & articles under the <a href="../../index.html#post">Posts</a> section, while typing my personal notes and useful information under the <a href="https://salihkilicli.gitbook.io/notes/">Notes</a> section. I love sharing my knowledge and experience as teaching is one of my life-long passions.</p>

<p>So, please feel free to contact me to ask anything and everything (literally) if there is any way that I can help you in your DS journey!</p>

    <br>
    <li>Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.</li>
    <br>
    <li>I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.</li>
