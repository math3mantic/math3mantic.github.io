# Data Science Portfolio Website

This is my portfolio and blog site which can be reached @ https://salihkilicli.github.io/

The webpage was built on Hugo's [Toha](https://themes.gohugo.io/toha/) theme and the creator of the theme is [Emruz Hossain](https://github.com/hossainemruz/).

Notes:

- I will be sharing blog posts related to Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science under the `Posts` section.
- I will also be sharing my personal Data Science projects under the `Projects` setion.
- Under the `Notes` section I will be posting Data Science/ML/DL tutorials (from scratch) and notes to remind myself some of the advanced topics I regularly forgot :)
